# c-sharp-3D-project
A 3D project to help me understand the basics of C# for use in application development. This README will document what I've learned so far:

1. Created a point class 
2. Created a line class 
  - Wrote a method to calculate its own length
  - Learned NUnit 3 to verify the method worked
3. Created a triangle class
  - Wrote methods for perimeter and area calculation
  - Wrote tests to validate the calculation methods
4. Created a point collection class 
  - Wrote methods for point adding, removing, and returning entire point collection, learning to work with Lists
  - Made methods to read and write points to and from .csv files into the collection with tests
  - Learned how to test for exceptions thrown, to test that read method throws exception when file does not exist
5. Wrote a PointUtility class to help generate default points for tests, and write a Point's coordinates to Console for testing
